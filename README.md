Project VISION

Our team, Minders , created 2 distinc robotic systems. 
  The first one is a lego robot, which posses a pixy camera(http://charmedlabs.com/default/pixy-cmucam5/)
This camera is able to distunguish objects by their colour. Thus our robot was able to recognise different "objects and to follow them.
Once it had located an object the robot used his 3-link lego arm with a PID controller in order to take the object and move it to the 
trash area.

  The second one is a model of a future town , which had undreground layers. In this town all public bins were connectedvia an underground system 
  which collected all the garbage. In this place a robotic system (town_unblocker) made sure that only a garbage was able to pass every
  second to the second layer, which shorted the garbage via a lego pneumatic system. After being sorted the garbage ended up in distinct
  3-d printed boxes which when they were fulled they were guided back to the surface.
